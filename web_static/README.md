# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

# HTML
# CSS
# Front-end

# Background Context

Now that we have a command interpreter for managing our AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!
Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.
The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:
- Create simple HTML static pages
- Style guide
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything

During this project, we learnt how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of our page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of our page, the design.

These tasks involve creating HTML pages with specific layouts and styling using CSS. Here's a breakdown of each task:

### Task 0: Inline styling
- Create an HTML page with a header and a footer.
- The body should have no margin or padding.
- The header should have a red color and a height of 70px.
- The footer should have a green color and a height of 60px.
- The text "Best School" should be centered vertically and horizontally in both the header and footer.

### Task 1: Head styling
- Similar to Task 0 but use the style tag in the head tag instead of inline styling.

### Task 2: CSS files
- Similar to Task 1 but use separate CSS files for global styles, header styles, and footer styles.

### Task 3: Zoning done!
- Similar to Task 2 but with additional styling for fonts, headers, and footers.
- Use images for icons in the browser tab and logo in the header.
- Keep the common styles consistent across the page.

### Task 4: Search!
- Add a filters box with a search button between the header and footer.
- Style the filters box and search button according to the provided specifications.

### Task 5: More filters
- Add locations and amenities filters with dropdown lists.
- Style the filters and dropdown lists accordingly.

### Task 6: It's (h)over
- Add contextual dropdowns to the location and amenities filters.
- Style the dropdown lists accordingly.

### Task 7: Display results
- Display a section for places below the filters section.
- Style the places section and place listings according to the provided specifications.

### Task 8: More details
- Add more information to the place listings, including price, amenities, user, and description sections.
- Style the additional information accordingly.

### Task 9: Full details
- Add even more details to the place listings, including amenities lists and reviews sections.
- Style the additional details accordingly.

### Task 10: Flex
- Improve the places section layout using Flexbox for all place articles.

### Task 11: Responsive design
- Make the page responsive to display correctly on mobile or small screens.

### Task 12: Accessibility
- Improve accessibility support, such as color contrast and header tags.

Each task builds upon the previous one, adding new features and styles while maintaining consistency and adherence to specifications.
